## Animation methods

### Time based functional animations
- Bind functions to properties with time to achieve simple animation primitives
- Implement a few as an example

### Easing/Interpolation based -> Keyframe Animation Systems
- Implementation of keyframe interpolation with different easing functions
- Support for parametric curves (BÃ©zier, splines) for smooth motion paths
- Yield-based animation sequencing for complex, chainable animations
- Animation state machines for transitions between different behaviors

### Procedural Animation Techniques
- Inverse Kinematics (IK) for goal-directed limb movement
- Forward Kinematics for direct joint angle control (in theory, not likely to implement)
- Procedural walk cycles with configurable gait parameters
- Noise-based animation (Perlin/Simplex/just Random) for organic movement

### Physics-based Animation (Verlet integration / talk about physics solvers in a concise way)
- Particle systems with forces and constraints
- Soft-body physics simulations (Just theory, way too complex)
- Spring-mass systems for secondary motion effects
- Rigid body dynamics with collision resolution

### Emergent Behavior Systems
- Boids/flocking algorithms with separation, alignment, and cohesion
- Cellular automata (Conway's Game of Life)
- Agent-based systems with simple rule sets (Moss particle experiment? Need compute shaders.)

### Data-driven Animation (in theory only)
- Motion capture data integration and retargeting
- Statistical/ML-based animation synthesis
- Blend trees for combining and mixing animations
- Basically combine the fixed nature of regular animations with keyframe and ruleset based easing

## Comparison techniques

### Performance Metrics
- How well does it scale with increased usage?
- How well can it be adapted?
- How much human intervention does it need to work correctly?

### Complexity Analysis
- Implementation complexity (lines of code, development time)
- Mathematical complexity (degrees of freedom, equations required)
- Artistic control vs. emergent behavior trade-offs
- Maintainability and extensibility of different approaches

### Visual Quality Assessment
- Subjective evaluation criteria for animation naturalness
- Quantitative metrics for movement smoothness
- Analysis of motion variety and unpredictability
- Appropriateness for different application domains (games, UI, data viz)
