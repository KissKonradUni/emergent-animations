\section{Introduction}

This paper explores how rule-based systems can be used to generate animated behavior from simple principles. The goal is to demonstrate how complexity can emerge from straightforward motion primitives and constraints.

As introduced by Reynolds in his seminal work on flocking behavior~\cite{boids87}, ...
or 
\textcite{boids87} introduced a distributed model for flocking behavior.
