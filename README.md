# Emergent Animation Systems
**From Interpolation to Procedural Motion**

This project explores how animation systems can be built using simple rules, gradually increasing in complexity from basic interpolation techniques to emergent, procedural movement.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `web_example/`  
  An interactive webpage demonstrating key animation concepts.  

- `docs/`  
  The LaTeX documentation folder for the academic writeup.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement various animation paradigms:
  - Time-based interpolation with custom easing curves
  - Rule-based systems such as Conway's Game of Life, Boids, etc.
  - Simple 2D joint-based procedural animation (walking patterns)
- Visualize how complex and dynamic movement can arise from minimal input and simple rules.
- Compare and evaluate the strengths of different animation approaches.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Deno / Vite / TypeScript (for web demos)
- LaTeX (academic documentation)

---

## 📖 References

Relevant literature on animation systems, procedural motion,
and rule-based behavior will be added as the documentation progresses.

All academic sources will be included and cited in the LaTeX paper under `docs/`.
